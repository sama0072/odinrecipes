	<h1> This is a recipe for baked chicken schnitzel </h1>

	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Oil</li>
		<li>Chicken</li>
		<li>Flour</li>
		<li>Paprika</li>
		<li>Eggs</li>
		<li>Bread crumbs</li>
		<li>Lemon zest</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Recipe </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.</li>
		<li>Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.</li>
		<li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the pan, then drizzle with more oil. Bake the chicken for five or six minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
	</ol>
